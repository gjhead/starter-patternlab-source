# starter-patternlab-source
Personal Pattern Lab Source Starter files.  YMMV and these may be out of date also.

These (along with many of my other github starter files) are put here just for my own memory/usage.  These are not organized or optimized for public consumption - and are just a place for me to start.

I update these a LOT and most likely what is here on github may be out of date or missing something.  I usually update these a bit with every project I work on.

This specific starter file is for Pattern Lab II and contains:

/source starter files
basic grunt setup
